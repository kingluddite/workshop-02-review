# Week 2: New Concepts

Welcome to Week 2 of our learning journey! In this week, we'll explore a variety of new concepts that are fundamental to web development and version control. Let's dive into each topic:

## 1. CSS Syntax

Understanding CSS syntax is crucial for styling web pages. Learn how to use selectors, properties, and values to apply styles to HTML elements, enhancing the visual appeal of your web content.

## 2. Adding CSS Three Ways

Explore the three ways to add CSS to HTML: Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS. Each method has its advantages and use cases, allowing you to choose the most appropriate approach for your project.

## 3. Element/Class/ID Selectors

Delve into the different types of selectors in CSS. From basic element selectors to more specific class and ID selectors, discover how to target and style specific elements on your web page.

## 4. The CSS Box Model

Grasp the concept of the CSS Box Model, which defines how HTML elements are structured and how padding, borders, and margins contribute to the overall layout of your web page.

## 5. Shorthand Properties

Learn about shorthand properties in CSS, a concise way to write multiple related property values in a single line, making your stylesheets more readable and efficient.

## 6. Other Properties

Explore additional CSS properties beyond the basics. Gain insights into properties for text, backgrounds, and other style elements that add depth and creativity to your web designs.

## 7. CSS Specificity

Understand the concept of CSS specificity, which determines the priority of styles when multiple rules apply to the same element. Mastering specificity helps you create more predictable and maintainable stylesheets.

## 8. Advanced Selectors

Go beyond basic selectors and explore advanced selectors in CSS. From attribute selectors to pseudo-classes, these techniques provide fine-grained control over styling elements based on various conditions.

## 9. CSS Inheritance

Discover how CSS properties are inherited by child elements from their parent elements. Grasp the principles of inheritance to streamline your stylesheet and make it more consistent.

## 10. Git

Introduce yourself to Git, a powerful version control system. Learn how to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your project's history effectively using Git.

## 11. Node & NPM

Explore Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), essential tools for modern web development. Understand how Node.js enables server-side JavaScript, while npm facilitates the installation and management of third-party packages.

Let's embark on this exciting journey of learning and expanding your web development skills! Each concept builds a strong foundation for your future projects, and by the end of this week, you'll have a deeper understanding of CSS, version control with Git, and the role of Node.js and npm in web development. Happy coding!
